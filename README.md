Project CSV is a small and simple web application that makes it easy to view and edit [.CSV (comma-separated values)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files anywhere using a browser, with a sleek and easy to use interface that fits well on mobile and desktop. All file data is processed locally on the users end, and does not get sent over the network, nor is any other data collected, stored, or sent over the network. This makes it possible to download the webpage for offline use as well - replacing the need for Project CSV - Desktop.
